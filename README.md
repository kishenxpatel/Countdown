# Countdown
Countdown Game project for the OxfordHackathon 2020. Based on the TV show but designed to be one-player as game to be played in lockdown.

### Objective

Lockdown can be boring at home - and 
some people have nobody but themselves 
to keep them occupied. Why not keep your 
brain active by playing a game that tests
your lexical and mathematical skills? 

### Rules
##### Letters Round:
30 seconds to make a word from a given selection of letters, chosen by the user or randomly generated by the computer

##### Numbers Round:
30 seconds to use the basic mathematical operations to reach a computer-given number from a selection of numbers chosen by the user

### Technical
Coded in Python and Tkinter
